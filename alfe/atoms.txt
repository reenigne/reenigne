What is the relationship between types and atoms?
  An atom can be thought of as a vtable pointer. It has type Atom and if type T
   has a run-time idenitity its atom is T::atom.
  An atom by itself doesn't tell you:
    How many members the type has
    What their types are
    What the methods in the vtable are
   You need a separate type definition to find those.
  Given an atom, all you can do with it is compare it to other Atom values for
   equality.

Symbol is a completely dynamic type (with no vtable) in the C++ implementation
 due to the limitations of C++. In Unity, each Symbol atom should correspond to
 a real type, and we should still be able to do all the pattern-matching stuff
 we need to.
