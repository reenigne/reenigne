Special syntax for types. Given types Foo, Bar:
  "Foo*" means "Pointer<Foo>"
    Also some const syntax?
    Suppose we spell C++'s "const int" as "Const Int"
    In C++:
      "Foo* p" means that both p and *p can be changed - in ALFE: "Pointer<Foo> p" or "Foo* p".
      "const Foo* p" and "Foo const* p" mean that p can be changed but not *p - in ALFE: "Pointer<Const Foo> p"? "ConstPointer<Foo> p"? "Foo^ p"? "(Const Foo)* p"?
      "Foo* const p" means that *p can be changed but not p - in ALFE: "(Const Pointer)<Foo> p"? "Const Foo* p"? "Const (Foo*) p"? "Const Pointer<Foo> p"?
      "Foo const* const p" means that neither p nor *p can be changed - in ALFE: "(Const Pointer)<Const Foo> p"? "ConstPointer<Const Foo> p?" "Const Foo^ p"?
    Then, does "Const" bind more or less tightly than * in "Const Int*"? Visually, less tightly looks appropriate.
    ^ has the connotation of GCed or reference counted pointer in C++/CLI - maybe we should avoid making it mean "pointer to const" here for that reason.
    "Int" and "Const Int" are really different types.
    What about other C++ modifiers like mutable and volatile?

  "Foo | Bar" means "Either<Foo, Bar>" and is a reference type
    Similarly "Foo | Bar | Baz" means "Either<Foo, Bar, Baz>" etc.
    "Either<Foo>" has no special syntax and is not particularly useful - it's just an alias for "Foo".
    "Either<>" has no special syntax and is just an alias for "Bottom".
    If you store a non-reference type in an either, it'll be boxed
  "Foo?" means "Maybe<Foo>" and is only applicable to reference types
    It's also equivalent to "Foo | ()"
  "(Foo, Bar)" means "Tuple<Foo, Bar>"
    "(Foo)" means "Tuple<Foo>" which is exactly equivalent to "Foo" (so we can parenthesize
  "()" means "Tuple<>" aka "Void", the unit type
    Or should "()" mean the value of type Void? Can we make it mean both without confusing the parsing too much?
      That would mean that "()(())" and similar would be valid types

  "Foo[]" means "Array<Foo>" - is this a type?
    If so, is it more like C++ std::vector<Foo> (value type) or more like C Foo[] (confusion with pointer)?
    I suspect we don't actually need this - we can pass Foo* instead, and we can't create values of type Foo[]
      We can write "Int[] x = {1,2,3};" but this is really just an Int[3] - the length is elided.

  What does "Foo[2]" mean? Is this a type? Is Array a special template that can accept integers as well as types?
    (Or does "Foo[2]" mean "Array<Foo, Struct { value = 2; }>"?
    Array is a special template (equivalent, a series of templates)
    "Foo[2]" is a value type, and when copied it copies the entire array rather than decaying to a pointer like in C.
    Can we slice arrays?
      Foo[10] b = ...;
      Foo[2] a = b[3..4];  // Or 3..5? Or 3:5 like Python?
    Is there an implicit conversion from Foo[n+1] to Foo[n]?


Special syntax for Tuples:

  (Foo, Bar) func(Baz);
  Baz baz;
  (Foo, Bar) fb = func(baz);
  Foo f;
  Bar b;
  (f, b) = fb;
  fb = (Foo(), Bar());
  fb = (Foo, Bar);  // same
  (f, b) = func(baz);
  (a, b) = (b, a);  // swap

  (a, b, c) op (d, e, f) == (a op d, b op e, c op f)
  (a, b, c) op d == (a op d, b op d, c op d)
    Or maybe not, since op could in principle be overloaded for Tuple
      Maybe these are built-in overloads for the built-in operators
    What about functions (especially pure functions) that do not accept a Tuple directly?
      Might be confusing for user-defined functions, but perhaps built-in functions
        Maybe have an easy way to define such functions so that user-defined functions can do it too
          Auto foo<@K : K is Tuple<@T, ...>>(K k) { (T t, Auto r) = k; return (foo(t), foo(r)); }  // But that would only work for 2-tuples
          Or perhaps a special syntax like "Auto foo(Tuple);"



"Foo?" is not the same as "Foo | Null" since "Foo??" is not the same as "Foo | Null | Null" which would be the same as "Foo | Null"
  Hence the operand of "?" has to be wrapped in some way to distinguish between operand Null and "?" Null.
    So Foo? is more like "Just<Foo> | Null"
  Foo?? has two possible non-Foo values as well as the Foo values:
    Foo?? f;
    f = Null;
    f = Just(Null);
    f = Just(Just(Foo));
    ...
    if (f is Null)
      ...
    else {
      Foo? g = (Foo?)f;
      if (g is Null)
        ...
      else {
        Foo h = (Foo)g;
        ...
      }
    }
    The conversion from Foo? to Foo will throw if the Foo? is a Null
      If the compiler can prove it's not (e.g. because we're in an else clause of a Null check) then the check is suppressed and we can guarantee nothrow without a catch.
    To represent Maybe, the compiler will have to wrap possibly-Null values somehow - either converting nulls to other representations (pointers <64K should all be bad on a machine with >=32 bits)
     or boxing.

Currying:
  Suppose we have:
    Foo f(Bar a, Baz b) { ... }
    Bar a;
    Baz->Foo g = f(a);
    Baz->Foo* p = &g;
  What should the representation of g be?
    If we need to pass around the function pointer, we can create a trampoline or even a partial compilation of f.
    That object will need to be reference counted so that it can be cleared up when all the strong references to it disappear
      So, we need to be careful with raw pointers to functions (unlike with C/C++) just as we need to be careful with raw pointers to anything else.
  How do we distinguish partial evaluation from overloaded functions?
    Foo f(Bar a, Baz b) { ... }
    Foo f(Bar a) { ... }
    Bar a;
    Auto g = f(a);
  I think that will have to mean the call is to "Foo f(Bar a)". So we need another syntax for partial evaluation
    Auto g = f(a, ??????);
  Perhaps we should not have anything special for supporting currying at all, instead we can make a trampoline by hand with a closure:
    Foo f(Bar a, Baz b) { ... }
    Bar a;
    Foo g(Baz b) { return f(a, b); }
    Baz->Foo* p = &g;
  What if the function is declared as:
    Foo f(Baz b)(Bar a) { ... }
      Then it's not ambiguous and we can partially evaluate. This also serves as a hint about functions that are designed for partial evaluation.
    So "Foo f(Bar a, Baz b)" is not quite the same as "Foo f(Baz b)(Bar a)" -


Is "((A,B),C)" the same as "(A,B,C)"?
  If so we could pass a 3-element tuple to a generic function expecting a 2-element tuple
    Are there any more serious errors, such as passing a tuple in one place causing the wrong element to be tupled?
      No, if we have a tuple structure we can always follow it despite what types we put in it
    Actually I think this is okay. Is there another reason we would not want to make Tuple binary?
      It feels like an implementation detail leaking into the language
    What are the reasons for making Tuple binary?
      It might make it easier to do variadic things - peeling off an argument at a time.
  I think from a principle of least surprise point of view, ((A,B),C) and (A,B,C) should be different. If we find a really good reason to change that, we can.
    Not making them the same also makes sense from the point of view of the Tuple<A,B,C> representation.

Should we have the ability to pattern match the tuple structure when finding templates?
  We get that automatically because of Tuple<> representation
  So do we then need the <> representation at all? Why not make all templates have a single (possibly Tuple) argument?
    "Foo<@A,@B> = Class { A a; B b; ... };" is semantically equivalent to:
    "Foo<(@A,@B)> = Class { A a; B b; ... };"
  However, the second implies that we'd want to instantiate with a single Tuple class that comes from somewhere else, the first implies that the two arguments are otherwise unrelated.

(Int,Int) is not the same as Int[2] because the latter can be indexed by a number and the former can't.
  Should we make it possible to index into tuples with the [] operator?
    That would yield a difference between 1-tuples and n-tuples where n>1.
      In the presence of conversion operators from non-tuples to tuples, that already exists.
        Let's wait and see if it would come in handy.



Top is the universal supertype, but it isn't very useful on its own - you can't create variables of type Top since we wouldn't know what size to make it.
  However, it is useful as an argument to type constructor. "Top*" can accept a pointer to any type - it's roughly the same as void* in C or C++.

Object is the supertype of all reference types.

Bottom is the universal subtype. It's the return type of functions that can't return (e.g. "exit()" and "throw()").

  sequence: "[T]" or "Reference<ISequence<T>>" or "Empty | (T, [T])"
  tuple: "(U, V)" or "Tuple<U, V>"
  union: "U | V" or "Reference<Union<U, V>>" - get U out with "w.U" or "w as U" or "cast<U>(w)", find out if it is U with "w is U"
  option: "Maybe<T>" or "T?" or "T | Null"
  function: "U -> V"

Need to figure out precedence and associativity
  A->B means the same as B(A)

In the presence of the "|" type operator, what is the state of multiple inheritance?
  A is Liskov-substitutable for both A|B and A|C.
  However, A does not inherit any members or methods from either.
  So as well as what it directly inherits from, a class implicitly inherits from any Either<> that has it as an argument
  Any Either<> type inherits from any Either<> type with a superset of the arguments
  Given "Foo = Class : FooBase { ... }; Bar = Class : BarBase { ... };" does "Foo | Bar" inherit from "FooBase | BarBase"?
    Yes via Liskov-substitution
  Given "Foo = Class : Base { ... }; Bar = Class : Base { ... };" does "Foo | Bar" inherit from Base?
    Yes via Liskov-substitution
      So some Either<> types do have members - they have the members of any common base classes


Possible Unit types:
  Type     value
  --------------
  Unit     unit
  Null     null
  Void     void
  ()       ()
  [Bottom] []
I think we can make these all aliases for each other (i.e. equivalent to C null pointer)

A unit type is any type that doesn't have any data members - i.e. doesn't carry any information other than its own type
  There may be many different unit types

Allow a type as an expression? (The value is the result of default constructing the type)
  Then () is just a default constructed ().
  To avoid ambiguity, such values aren't allowed everywhere that a name is.

  If we do that, then does Foo.x mean default construct Foo and then dereference, or does it mean a static member x of Foo?
    Maybe could mean either, depending on whether x is a static member of Foo or not.
  Also, does "A|B" mean "default construct (A|B)" or does it mean "(default construct A) | (default construct B)"?
    I would expect the former, since the type operator | is stronger than implicit default construction



Have a run-time type operator typeOf()?
  And "Type" - the type of the value that it returns
  The Type object of type T is T::type.
    Or T.type? We might want to use "." everywhere that C++ uses "::", since I think we can
  print("Compile-time type is ${TypeOf(x)::type}, run-time type is ${typeOf(x)}\n");
    Type has a toString() method, but the strings are not linked in unless used.

Sequence type "[Foo]" needs to:
  act as an immutable value (therefore reference counted)
  allow getting the head value and tail sequence
Possible implementations:
  Pointer to:
    Reference count
    Head value
    Tail implementation
  Offset into array and pointer to:
    Reference count
    Lengths
    Array of elements
  Whatever else makes sense for the code in question.

Should we have Tyco, Type and Template classes? They would probably make the type checking stuff less wordy.
  Type and Template are both special cases of Tyco
  A Type can come from a TycoDefinitionStatement (which is a ParseTreeObject) or an instantiation of a template (which isn't)
    We could make instantiating a template create a TycoDefinitionStatement (which just happens not to have a valid Span)


A TycoDefinitionStatement associates a TycoSignifier (i.e. a TycoIdentifier and optional TemplateParameters) with a TycoSpecifier (i.e. a string representing a Tyco)
  So we probably should have a Tyco class distinct from TycoDefinitionStatement
    Tyco is either a StatementTyco (which has a reference to TycoDefinitionStatement) or InstantiatedTyco (which doesn't)
    Tyco is responsible for all the instantiation, type checking and conversion stuff which isn't related to the parsing
    Tyco has a toString() method.
      The string printed may be different for different types, depending on context
        If we're printing an error message about a type, we want to use the name the user referred to the type by:
          Foo = FooTemplate<A>;
          Bar = BarTemplate<B>;
          Int f(Foo x) { ... };
          Bar y;
          f(y);  // should print something like "Expected Foo, found Bar" rather than "Expected FooTemplate<A>, found BarTemplate<B>".
        So for each expression we need to keep track of its actual type and an appropriate TycoSpecifier


  A single TycoDefinitionStatement may ultimately define many Tycos (via instantiation) or even none
  Similarly, a single FunctionDefinitionStatement may ultimately definite many Functions or none


How do we call a constructor?
  "Foo" is a type
    but "Foo()" is a type as well (function returning Foo)
    Does "Foo(Bar)" mean "default construct a Bar then use it to construct a Foo" or does it mean "default construct a type taking Bar and returning Foo"?
      The latter doesn't make sense - we can't actually construct a function type
      This doesn't work so well for "Foo[2]" since that could well be a default constructed array of length 2 or a call of operator[] on a default-constructed Foo
        So maybe we always need parentheses for a constructor call
          No, but since we can't construct function types we can always use the parentheses for disambiguation
          This means that we can use a type specifier whereever we need a value
            The integral types (e.g. "2") are weird because the value constructed doesn't inhabit the type

Can we implement intersection types?



A structure that we can use the . operator on needs to have its representation be a Value<Structure*>, not a Value<Vector>
  More generally, any type has two representations - the ALFE representation (dynamically typed, static type Value) and the C++ representation (statically typed, e.g. Vector)
    Type should be responsible for converting between them
      However, we can't have templated virtual functions, so the child class can't know about the compile-time type
        Pass it as an Any
      It'd be nice if we can do it in a way which doesn't break Berapa (even if we later modify Berapa to use it)
      Who owns the Structure*? (Not the first time we've had this problem)
        Really in this case it has to be the ConfigFile, or more generally another Structure
          At the moment, a Structure is just a lookup table (Identifier->Value). Should we also have something in Structure to hold other Structures?
            This needs to be optional so that Berapa Components can be contained within other Components
              Could we separate the C++ representation from the Structure? Then a Structure would always be owned by a ConfigFile or a Structure
      Value Type::valueFromAny(Any a, Structure* owner)
      Any Type::anyFromValue(Value v)
