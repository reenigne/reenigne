XTCE-trace - a cycle exact XT emulator

This program executes a .com file and outputs a trace (one line per cycle)
showing what the bus and microcode engine are doing each cycle.

To use, simply run the program from the console specifying the name of your
.com file as the argument:

trace.exe test.com

The output will be printed to the console. You can redirect it to a file in
the usual way:

trace.exe test.com >test.log

XTCE currently implments the following devices:
* 8088 CPU
* 640kB RAM
* 8237 Direct Memory Acccess (DMA) controller
* 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)
* 8253 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)
* 8255 Programmable Peripherial Interface (PPI)
* DMA page registers
* NMI switch (though currently there is no way to trigger an NMI anyway).

The program will be loaded and executed at 0x00a8:0x0100, and execution will
continue until CS:IP reaches 0x0000:0x0000, which is the address that the
"int 0x20" vector points at. There is an "int 0x20" instruction at
0x00a8:0x0000 for terminating the program in the usual way (e.g. executing
a "ret" instruction without pushing anything on to the stack first) but
there are no DOS or BIOS services installed. Also no interrupts or DRAM
refresh DMA cycles will occur by default, but these can be enabled by
programming the corresponding devices in the usual way.

XTCE is based on XTCE-microcode which has passed more than 11,000,000 tests
to ensure cycle exactness. The following areas of its CPU implementation have
not yet been tested for cycle-exactness:
* The trap flag.
* Hardware interrupts occurring between instructions or during instructions
other than HLT and WAIT.
