        - 16550 will interrupt if data exists in the FIFO and isn't read
          within the time it takes to receive four bytes or if no data is
          received within the time it takes to receive four bytes.

        - Baud rate divisors can be calculated by taking the oscillating
          frequency (1,843,200) and dividing by the quantity of the desired
          baud rate times the UART clocking factor (16).  Use the following
          formula:
^divisor = 1843200 / (BaudRate * 16);

        - interrupt pending flag uses reverse logic, 0 = pending, 1 = none
        - interrupt will occur if any of the line status bits are set
        - THRE bit is set when THRE register is emptied into the TSR

         10        8 bytes
         11       14 bytes

        - Bit 0 must be set in order to write to other FCR bits
        - Bit 1 when set to 1 the RCVR FIFO is cleared and this bit is reset.
          The receiver shift register is not cleared.
        - Bit 2 when set to 1 the XMIT FIFO is cleared and this bit is reset.
          The transmit shift register is not cleared.

         01 = 6 bits per character
         10 = 7 bits per character
         11 = 8 bits per character

        - stop bits = 1.5 for 5 bit words or 2 for 6, 7 or 8 bit words
        - bit 7 changes the mode of registers 3F8 and 3F9.  If set these
          registers become the LSB and MSB of the baud rate divisor.
          Otherwise 3F8 is the Transmit/Receive Buffer Register and 3F9 is
          the Interrupt Enable Register.

         滥聊聊哪哪哪哪 reserved (zero)

        - If bit 4 is set, data from the Transmit Shift Register is received
          in the Receiver Shift Register.  The SOUT line is set to logic
          high, the SIN line and control lines are disconnected.   CTS, DSR,
          RI and CD inputs are disconnected.  DTR, RTS, OUT1 and OUT2 are
          then connected internally.


^Port 3FD - Line Status Register - LSR  (read only)

         滥哪哪哪哪哪 1 = 16550 PE/FE/Break in FIFO queue, 0 for 8250 & 16450

        - Bit 0 is set when a byte is placed in the Receiver Buffer Register
          and cleared when the byte is read by the CPU (or when the CPU
          clears the FIFO for the 16550).  Results in Receive Data Available
          Interrupts if enabled.
        - Bits 1-4 indicate errors and result in Line Status Interrupts
          if enabled.
        - Bit 1 is set when a second byte is received before the byte
          in the Receiver Buffer Register is read by the CPU (the 16550 in
          FIFO mode sets this bit when the queue is full and the byte in the
          Receiver Shift Register hasn't been moved into the queue).  This
          bit is reset when the CPU reads the LSR
        - Bit 2 is set whenever a byte is received that doesn't match the
          requested parity.  Reset upon reading the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains
          parity information with each byte and sets bit 2 only when the byte
          is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
        - Bit 3 is set when a character is received without proper stop
          bits.  Upon detecting a framing error the UART attempts to
          resynchronize.  Reset by reading the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains
          this information with each byte and sets bit 3 only when the byte
          is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
        - Bit 4 is set when a break condition is sensed (when space is
          detected for longer than 1 fullword).  A zero byte is placed in
          the Receiver Buffer Register (or 16550 FIFO).  Reset by reading
          the LSR.  (The 16550 maintains this information with each byte and
          sets bit 4 only when the byte is at the top of the FIFO queue.)
        - Bit 5 is set when the Transmit Holding Register shifts a byte
          into the Transmit Shift Register (or XMIT FIFO queue is empty for
          16550) and is cleared when a byte is written to the THR (or the
          XMIT FIFO).   Results in Transmit Holding Register Empty interrupts
          if enabled.
        - Bit 6 is set when both the Transmitter Holding Register and the
          Transmitter Shift Register are empty. On the 16550, when the XMIT
          FIFO and Transmitter Shift Register are empty.
        - Bit 7 is 16550 specific and indicates there is a byte in the FIFO
          queue that was received with a Parity, Framing or Break error.

        - Bit 5 is the Modem Control Register DTR during loopback test
        - Bit 6 is the Modem Control Register OUT1 during loopback test
        - Bit 7 is the Modem Control Register OUT2 during loopback test

^Port 3FF/2FF - Scratch Pad Register  (read/write)

%       Programming considerations:
        - 8250's, 16450's are essentially identical to program
        - 16550's is pin and software compatible with the 16450 but has an
          internal FIFO queue that may be enabled/disabled by software
        - PCs are capable of 38.4Kb, while AT's are capable of 115.2Kb
        - receiver checks only the first stop bit of each character regardless
          of the number of stop bits specified
        - Older 8250 and 16450 UARTs may lose THRE interrupt if the THRE and
          Receive Data (RD) or the Line Status (LS) interrupts occur
          simultaneously during a full duplex transmission.  RD and LS have
          higher priority than THRE which causes the lower priority interrupt
          to be lost.  The following are 3 methods used to avoid this problem:

          1. Disable/re-enable THRE interrupt via the IER after processing
             Receive Data & Line Status interrupts.
          2. While inside the RD and LS interrupt routines check the LSR
             THRE bit and set a flag that a THRE interrupt was waiting.
          3. Poll the LSR THRE bit instead of using the IRR.

        - data loss can occur without overrun or framing errors if the
          interrupts are serviced too slowly
        - reserved bits are usually set to zero.  Code should NOT rely on
          this being the case since future enhancement may use these bits
