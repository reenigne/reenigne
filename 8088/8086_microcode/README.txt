Microcode in this processor is 512 instructions * 21-bits wide

  10-bits source, 10-bits destination, 10 bits uops, 1-bit flags

...42 years later, in the middle of COVID-19 everyone seems to have
too much time...

Elon Musk announced the 4680 batteries, giga casting and the Giga Press; and some
other people went hunting for bits---for the purposes of educational
exploration ...

Actually doing this analysis; 40 years early rougly the same exercise
was doing purely by hand by every other silicon chip manfacturer on
the planet, for the purpose of producing their own compatible chips.

Minor hackery to allow running under *nux with g++: Paul Sladen

Have fun... expect lots of university classes in the future will include
references to this!
