  Remove dedup code                                           Fixed but commented
Changing segment too often in initial staticDisassembly       Not a bug
Remove debug spew from StaticDisassembler                     Fixed but commented
Search for runs of zeroes and elide                           No need to fix now that we suppress uninitialised
Write a program to look up a binary string in game.exe, search for it in m.exp and return the symbol. Run it on all the data symbols    No longer needed

Get rid of ping                                               Fixed
Add predecessors for dynamic jumps
Add predecessors for data accesses
Comment branch/jump/call instructions with source address
Mark filenames as read                                        Should be fixed but not working (see p3D85_0707)
Back-propagate bad from 1d25_000e to 194c_3d9b - segment change resets
Need a way to find or mark jump tables - missing code at 1ecb_0614
  Jump table at 11fb_2106 has values and target
  Jump table at 11fb_22c2 only has targets
Bad code at 210c_43f6 - mark ESC and WAIT as bad
  Don't statically disassemble after jmp?

Use symbol table
  Generate list of function addresses that can be used to make the config file
  Find extents of functions:
    Find places that are reached from CALL instructions
    Make sure they are only reached from CALL instructions
    Search ahead to find RET instruction
    Look at all successors and predecessors in range
    Make sure their targets are also in range
    Dump addresses of functions for making symbol table
  Put disassembly into Code format first
