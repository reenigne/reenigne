With hsync width 0, htotal = 0x66, get an active area with:
  hsync position = 0x53  yes
                   0x56  yes
                   0x57  yes
                   0x58  no
  hsync position = 0x5a  no
With hsync width 0xf, htotal = 0x66, get an active area with:
                   0x58  yes
                   0x59  no

if hsync_position + hsync_width > htotal + 1  then we don't get an active area
if the hsync never starts, then this isn't an issue

With horizontal_sync_position = 0x73, horizontal_total = 0x66 (103 characters)
  horizontal_displayed = 0x66  start address latches
  horizontal_displayed = 0x67  start address doesn't latch


So, plan is:
  horizontal_total = 80 and 32 (81 and 33, totalling 114)
  horizontal_displayed = 80  (80 columns in active scanline)
  horizontal_sync_position = 90 and 9 (no hsync in active, hsync at CRT char 90 in inactive)
  horizontal_sync_width = 0 or 15 (doesn't matter)
  vertical_total = 1         (2 rows per CRTC frame)
  vertical_total_adjust = 0  (0 extra scanlines)
  vertical_displayed = 1     (the active scanline forms the active width, the inactive scanline forms the overscan)
  vertical_sync_position = 25  (doesn't matter for now)
  interlace_mode = 0         (non-interlaced)
  max_scan_line_address = 0  (1 scanline per row)

Sequence:
  CRT char  CRTC char  raster             CPU
    0         0        active start
                                          Set horizontal_sync_position to 90
    9         9
                                          Set horizontal_total to 80
   32        32
                                          Set start address
   80        80        inactive start
   81         0        second CRTC frame  Set horizontal_sync_position to 9
   90         9        hsync start
                                          Set horizontal_total to 32
  106        25        hsync end

  114 = 0    33 = 0    active start



Distance from palette change to hsync start = 144 cycles
Palette write is at char 36 == cycle 96
palette write is at cycle 1420, first write at cycle 1299, so first write is at -25, which is 37 cycles too early


Distance from palette change to hsync start = 120 cycles
Palette write is at char 45 == cycle 120


What is the latency of waitForDisplayEnable? Something like 39.25 cycles - too many to be able to avoid cycle counting
  Presumably it takes 39 cycles when there's no refresh

2 scanlines is 1824 hdots
39 cycles is 117 hdots      1824 % 117 == 69  117 % 69 == 48  69 % 48 == 21  48 % 21 == 6  21 % 6 == 3  so gcd(1824, 117) == 3  == 1 CPU cycle
40 cycles is 120 hdots      1824 % 120 == 24  so gcd(1824, 120) == 24  == 8 CPU cycles, this could miss the pulse

In 1spf_intermittent, when it's working, why are there only a few initial phases where it works? There should be about 8.
How sure are we that the CRTC works by counting up and comparing rather than by loading and counting down?
  Pretty sure - counting down would require more transistors and horizontal probably works the same way as vertical
There is something wrong with my model of how the CRTC works. Possible problems:
  Counting down instead of up
    How could we test this?
      Change horizontal displayed etc during active time and see what happens

Plan:
  Display lockstep_visible and see if the CRTC copes with a 1-column screen
    It does, but the column could still be free-running
      Will need to have refresh off

"in al,dx ; stosb" is 21 cycles == 63 hdots
4*8 == 32 hdots
gcd(63, 32) = 1

waitForDisplayEnable == 37 cycles with refresh off


VMX, VSX, -misel



  Figure out why 1spf_intermittent is doing differenet things despite being in lockstep

  Try modifying values slightly to see how it affects number of working nop-counts


With refresh disabled, "readPIT16 0 / stosw" is 83 cycles (20.75 IOs)


Phase 2 - worked with initial=70 (twice) but then not in 1spf_intermittent.bin ?  Did I change something between them? No
  Try 66
  Try 61, 63, 66, 69, 71

Phase 4 - worked with initial=21 then worked in  1spf_intermittent.bin as well   13 NOPs before refresh set
  This doesn't work phase 2



New version (with "initCGA 1" and safeRefresh in place again)
Phase 2, 1spf2_intermittent.bin



In all our experiments, we seem to get overscan and active swapped much more often than correct
  This suggests there is some problem with having a scanline that has active data but no hsync


Plan:
  Try with 1 row of 2 scanlines
    That will put things in overscan though
  Try having vertical_displayed == 2 and setting horizonta_displayed == 1 in the overscan - then both scanlines are active and there's no asymmetry problem
    Then increase htotal for active scanline to push the extra column under the bezel
  Can we make do without moving hsync? That implies having hsync in the long scanline
    Suppose we want 15 characters for hsync (90-105) - then we have 9 characters


Suppose our two horizontal totals are tl and tr, tl+tr == 114, tl>tr. Left scanline is 0 to tl, right scanline is tl to tl+tr
e: Set ht=tl between 0 and tr (width tr)
a: Set ht=tr between tl and tl+tr (width tr)
Suppose our two horizontal displayed values are dl and dr. dl>dr. dl<=tl. dr<=tr. dl=80. Want to minimize dr.
d: Set hd=dl between tl+dr and dr (width (tl+tr+dr)-(tl+dr) == tr)
b: Set hd=dr between dl and tl+dr (width dr+tl-dl). So we can have dr=1 safely
Suppose our two horizontal sync positions are sl and sr. sl > tl to suppress sync. sr < tr-sw  (sw = sync width)
c: Set hs=sl between tl+sr and sr (width (tl+tr+sr)-(tl+sr) == tr)
f: Set hs=sr between sr and tl+sr (width tl)

Worked example:
  active_left(80)  overscan_left(N)  active_right(1)  overscan_right(1)  sync(15)  overscan_final(17-N)
  Want the sync to be at 90, which gives N=8
  tl = 80+N = 88         (program 0x57)
  tr = 1+1+15+17-N = 26  (program 0x19)
  dl = 80
  dr = 1
  sl = 90
  sr = 2
  a width = tr = 26
  b width = dr+tl-dl = 1+88-80 = 9 characters = 72 hdots = 24 cycles = 6 IOs
  c width = tl = 26
  d width = tr = 26
  e width = tr = 26
  f width = tl = 88

Suppose we have a 34-character wide initial state

So, order is badcefHLPS


45-48
46,48
4: 46,48,49


With 34-character initial state and one "times 6 nop" block:
  phase2: 2, 4, 5
  phase4: 2, 5
Then with 1spf4_single, 2 works with phase2 but not phase4. 2 not reliable?
Same story with 5 - works (phase4) with 1spf4 but not 1spf4_single. Works with both in phase2

With 34-character initial state and two "times 6 nop" blocks, no usable values at all in phase4

With 34-character initial state and three "times 6 nop" blocks:
  phase2: 0, 3
Neither reliable in both phases with 1spf4_single

With 34-character initial state and four "times 6 nop" blocks:
  phase2: 1


With 34-character initial state, one "times 6 nop" block and 15 sync width
  phase4: 2, 4, 5

With 34-character initial state, one "times 6 nop" block and 10 sync width
  phase4: 2, 3, 5

With 34-character initial state, one "times 6 nop" block and 10 sync width, later capture
  phase4: 3

With 34-character initial state, one "times 6 nop" block and 15 sync width, later capture
  phase4: 1, 4
  phase4: 3

With 34-character initial state, one "times 6 nop" block and 15 sync width and lockstep
  phase2: 1, 2, 4
  phase2: 1, 2, 4
  phase2: 1, 2, 4
  phase4: 2, 4, 5
  phase2: 1, 2, 4
  1spf4_single:
    2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4




None of these are reliable.
  Can we make it reliable with a smaller hsync width?
    If so, try increasing overscan_final so that we can use width 15
  Try increasing one of the 1-character spans to 2

  Scanline 200:          2

    Before column 80        Vertical total set to 64

  Scanline 200 starts
    After column 0          Horizontal Total set to 114
    Before column 87        Horizontal Sync Position set to 90

What's actually happening?
  phase4, 1296-129a
  The first displayed line has start address 2
    Therefore, the code is running 2 scanlines too early
    However, if vertical total was set to 2 early then we'd get an extra ~64 CRTC scanlines of vertical overscan
    The first palette port write sets the overscan colour to 2.
      This is because there are two lodsbs before the first palette set
      Palette set is skipped on scanline 0 to set vertical total
      So scanline 0 is empty and the first visible scanline is scanline 1
      Why is scanline 0 empty?
        Two possibilities:
          One: Some signal is missing that is preventing enabling the display at the CRTC origin
            Seems unlikely - the long frame is clearly hitting vertical displayed, vertical sync start and vertical sync end
              Are we missing a horizontal signal? Would that matter?
          Two: During scanline 0 we're actually displaying scanline 63 of the long CRTC frame
        How can we distinguish between these two possibilities?
          What happens if we set vertical displayed to 64?
            Then scanline 0 displays long-frame data, which also suggests scenario Two
        Assume scenario Two for now.
          If long-frame is ending too late, it must also be starting too late

  What's going on at the end?
    Scanline 199 starts correctly
    Nothing appears in extra column of scanline 199
      Why? Trace says:
        Port e0 writes at 420, 722 (302), 1020 (298)
        Time from 0202 CRTC write to e0 write, 926->1020 == 94 (scanline 199), 622->722 == 100

    Scanline 200 repeats data from scanline 199


CRTC-scanline 0 is short and CRTC-scanline 1 is long:
  Scanline 260:         62
  Scanline 261:     63 VT    0
  Scanline   0:      1       0

                            Horizontal Sync Position = 2
                            Start address set for scanline 199

                            Set horizontal sync position to 90
                            Set vertical total to 64
  Column 80, VT latched (?)


Are the vertical total changes happening at the right times?
  Vertical Total <- 2
    Earliest is scanline 261a (63) column 80
    Latest is scanline 0a (1) column 80
    If it was too early or too late we'd have too much overscan
  Vertical Total <- 64
    If it was too early or too late we'd have 2 extra or 2 few scanlines, and the other VT would be in the wrong place (unless both are wrong by the same amount)

Vsync occurs on scanline 225. Programmed value = 25 so long frame starts on scanline 200 instead of 198. Therefore, setting vertical total to 64 is happening too late
  Need a better way to tell when vertical total is latched and if it depends on each CRTC-scanline having an hsync

start_address_latch: vsync is on scanline 50 of 87 - as expected.


Question: is long scanline firstVisible-1 the last scanline of the long frame or the second scanline of the first short frame?
  If the latter, why does display not get enabled?

Terminology: firstVisible is the first scanline that actually shows active VRAM data
scanline 0 is the second instantiation of the scanline macro in the code - it's supposed to be firstVisible, but in fact is firstVisible-1





1spf_newstart2 behavior (designed for CRTC-scanline 0 being short):
  phase4, 1341-1345, extra column is duplicate of column 1
          13d9-13dd - same
  So, what must be happening is this:
    CRTC-scanline 0 is long.
    When column passes 1, horizontal displayed is still 1 so next-row-start-address is latched

1spf_newstart behavior (designed for CRTC-scanline 0 being short):
  phase4, 1287-128b, extra column is duplicate of column 1

Check where start address is latched. May be a row or a scanline before CRTC origin
  Seems like start address is latched at display end of last scanline
  Seems like vertical total is latched at the same place


Fixing up last scanline
  Currently, CRTC-scanline 0 is short and CRTC-scanline 1 is long
  Is this is unavoidable or just a consequence of how it self-synchronizes?
    Does not seem to be unavoidable - it's the other way around on VWytseIj0XwW8P4623.png.raw (1spf4)
    However, changing ES to 5702 (so that no sync pulses are skipped) yields a large chunk of overscan at the top
  Assume CRTC-scanline 0 is short and CRTC-scanline 1 is long:
    Scanline -1:
      Left half is last of the overscan CRTC-scanlines
        Set horizontal total and horizontal sync position as if it's a normal scanline
        Can't set vertical total yet, so set start address for scanline 0
        Could set palette register but the effect would persist for two scanlines
      Right half is CRTC-scanline 0 as normal
    Scanline 0:
      Left half:
        Need to set vertical total. Do this instead of setting the palette

    Scanline 199:
      Left half
        Set vertical total instead of start address
        set horizontal total and horizontal sync position
      Right half:
        CRTC scanline 2
    Scanline 200:
      CRTC scanline 3
    Scanline 261 == -1
      CRTC scanline 64

With last-scanline fix:
  phase2: 28, 29, 30, 31, 32

With both VT sets in main loop:
  phase4: 1341-1345 every other scanline
  phase2: 138d-1391 every other scanline
  So these are a scanline apart - we've got a phase dependence for initial scanline somehow
With initial VT of 64:
  phase2: 1425-1429, 14bd-14c1, 138d-1391 every other scanline
  phase4: 13ca-13ce every other scanline    - still not reliable
With VT moved:
  phase4: 13f5-13f9
  phase2: 13b8-13bc
With VT moved all the way to before start address set
  phase4: 13f5-13f9
  phase2: 13b8-13bc
With VT on lines -1 and 198:
  phase2: 13b8-13bc
  phase4: 13f5-13f9
With 3 nops on the VT sets:
  phase4: 13f5-13f9
  phase2: 13b8-13bc
With waitForNoVerticalSync:
  phase4: 13d2-13d6
  phase2: 13d2-13d6
With PIT restart fixed:
  phase2: 142c-142e, 14c4-14c6, every other scanline
  phase4: 142c-142e, 14c4-14c6, every other scanline

1spf_horizontal with lockstep fix:

Program for checking wait states of each segment
Remove lockstep
Set up a horizontal-only screen
Wait for it to stabilize
Turn off refresh
Add possibility of moving the refresh (presumably refresh phase is why adding "out dx,al" to the beginning of the interrupt routine causes only a single position to work)
  Sync to CRTC horizontally using PIT
  wait for N cycles
  Turn on refresh with period 19
Check if routine is self-synchronizing or has slop
  Add "out dx,al" to start of interrupt routine
  Set up dx and al before hlt
  Add another palette change after critical part
  Check that DRAM won't decay
    With refresh off, waitForDisplayEnable loop is 37 cycles or 9.25 IOs, so we might be waiting for 10 scanlines
      But add 15 IOs for writePIT16, plus an interrupt latency
      Refresh safety is 1.5ms which is ~23 scanlines so we could hit issues
      Need an extra step to move the first test point left to undo the time of writePIT16 and interrupt latency
Fix up lockstep
Get 1spf_horizontal working consistently
  Try updated lockstep
Figure out how many DRAM refresh phases work for each initial delay (slop pattern)
See if changing left horizontal sync from 0x57 to 0x5a improves slop
Move current setup back to horizontal-only program and see if that has the same problem (and, if not, what the slop is there)
try moving VT set back to 0 and 198
